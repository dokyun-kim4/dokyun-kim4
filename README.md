### Hi! ðŸ‘‹  
My name is Dokyun Kim, a senior studying robotics at Olin College of Engineering.  
I'm passionate about computer vision & machine learning and how it can be used to improve human-robot interaction!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
   - A personal project with HuggingFace's SO100 arm
   - A proof-of-concept systems for instructional reading games in collaboration with Boston University Wheelock Institute for the Science of Education (WISE)
 
You can see my past projects [here](https://dokyun-kim4.github.io/portfolio/).
